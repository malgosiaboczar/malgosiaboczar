## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!<br>
### If there's a bug, I'll find it. If notâ€¦ I'll double-check;)

Once an e-commerce admin, now a software tester on a mission! ðŸš€ <br>
Iâ€™m always eager to grow and make sure every detail is just right. Along my journey, Iâ€™ve mastered exploratory testing, web app testing, writing test cases, reporting bugs and creating test reports.
I hold an [**ISTQB Foundation Level certificate**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GCh3_OaZgRL9pRCKyV_WIj58zvjf68pV/view?usp=sharing), which helps me test the right wayâ€”by the book, but with a testerâ€™s intuition.<br><br>
I know my way around SQL, Chrome DevTools, Jira+Confluence, Postman and even some Salesforce & HTML/CSS basics. Plus, I get how Scrum and Agile keep projects rolling smoothly.<br>
I'm also passionate about digital accessibility and making technology usable for everyone.<br>
